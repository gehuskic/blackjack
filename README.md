The previous program crawled so this program could run. 
This project is an important milestone to me because of the amount of concepts 
needed to be able to tie everything together. This program is the accumulation of 
learning the basics of functions, classes, and object orientated programming. 
Everything created from this point on will have the same basic ideology put into it.
